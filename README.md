Collinear spinwave calculations

Calculates Linear Spinwave Theory hamiltonians
This is the collinear only version of the work in J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 27 (2015) 166002.

For 2D materials only, this code can also calculate the magnetization vs. temperature curves. 
Here is an example given for the ferromagnetic CrI3 using magnetic coupling paramters in 2D Mater. 4 (2017) 035002.
